1. Hiring manager phone interview: ~30mins for background checking, skills and technical questions about embedded systems.

2. Coding phone interview: ~45mins - hiring manager.
   Given a schematic of microcontroller surgical system, design and write code for implementation
   - how to convert input I/O signals to variables that program can use
   - closed loop control (PID control) coding
   - more focused on the high level design.
   
3. Virtual Onsite Interview:
1) Recruiter checking ~30mins

2) Staff Software Engineer1: ~45mins
 - behavioral questions: most challenging project/complicated issues and how to solve?
 - technical question:
  a) given a black box system that software is not working, how to diagnostic?
  b) how is breakpoint working in IDE, mechanism behind it
  c) multi-thread: how to synchronizing data between different threads; mutex/thread-locking
  d) explain runtime polymorphism, how it is working
  e) software design pattern?
 - coding question:
  a) find closest number to a target in an array; optimization(binary search is not enough? asked using memory to compensate time?)
  b) find bitsets of decimal number:
   - give two solutions not enough? 1) convert to string and count '1' char 2) using bit shifting to count 1 (need to shift 32 times for integers, was asked for optimization)
  
3) Principal Electrical Engineer: ~45mins
 - what's the most interesting school/work projects and why enjoy it?
 - open to picking up new knowledge?
 - if having conflicts with colleagues, what will you do?
 - if colleagues is doing something dangerous, what will you do?
 - when having lots of to-do tasks, how to manage?
 - explain different conmmunicational protocols and their advantages/disadvantages.
 - given a schematic, temperature-resistor sensor and a microcontroller, how to let microcontroller output the temperaure?
  a) use ADC to convert voltage signal to digital input to send to microcontroller
  b) how do you measure the exact constant of k, given T = k * R?

4) Staff Software Engineer2: ~45min
 - Coding: given a schematic of temperature sensor, ADC and microcontroller, write code:
  a) how ADC converts analog voltage to digital signals (12bits);
  b) how processors do circular buffer(head pointer and tail pointer)?
   - processor1 pushes data into fixed-size buffer, processor2 pulls the data out from buffer
   - code should throw exception when buffer is full during pushing and when buffer is empty during polling

5) Software Engineer1:
 No coding, technical questions:
 - communication protocols
 - embedded system projects
 - c++ related questions:
  a) difference with C and C++
  b) what is namespace used for
  c) lambda expression/function and how to defind the scope? A: the field inside [] brackets is used for scopes
  d) what is #ifdef?
  e) what is generic? the type template in c++: queue<int>
  f) how to code multi-threads? in c++11
  g) c++11 related questions
  h) shared_pointer vs unique_pointer
 
6) Software Engineer2:
 - behavioral: the most difficult technical question have ever met and how to solve it?
 - coding: given a function bool get_adc_value(int timestamp, int adc_value), implements a code/data structure to sort the input in ascending order based on adc_value, print out the corresponding timestamps in order.
