1. Hiring manager phone interview: ~30mins for background checking, skills and technical questions about embedded systems.

2. Coding phone interview: ~45mins - hiring manager.
   Given a schematic of microcontroller surgical system, design and write code for implementation
   - how to convert input I/O signals to variables that program can use
   - closed loop control (PID control) coding
   - more focused on the high level design.
   
3. Virtual Onsite Interview:
1) Recruiter checking ~30mins

2) Staff Software Engineer1: ~45mins
 - behavioral questions: most challenging project/complicated issues and how to solve?
 - technical question:
  a) given a black box system that software is not working, how to diagnostic?
  b) how is breakpoint working in IDE, mechanism behind it
  c) multi-thread: how to synchronizing data between different threads; mutex/thread-locking
  d) explain runtime polymorphism, how it is working
  e) software design pattern?
 - coding question:
  a) find closest number to a target in an array; optimization(binary search is not enough? asked using memory to compensate time?)
  b) find bitsets of decimal number:
   - give two solutions not enough? 1) convert to string and count '1' char 2) using bit shifting to count 1 (need to shift 32 times for integers, was asked for optimization)
  
3) Principal Electrical Engineer: ~45mins
 - what's the most interesting school/work projects and why enjoy it?
 - open to picking up new knowledge?
 - if having conflicts with colleagues, what will you do?
 - if colleagues is doing something dangerous, what will you do?
 - when having lots of to-do tasks, how to manage?
 - explain different conmmunicational protocols and their advantages/disadvantages.
 - given a schematic, temperature-resistor sensor and a microcontroller, how to let microcontroller output the temperaure?
  a) use ADC to convert voltage signal to digital input to send to microcontroller
  b) how do you measure the exact constant of k, given T = k * R?
